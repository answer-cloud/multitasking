      These specs reference the example Project resource but are not removed by
      bin/remove-example, so deleting the example would break or silently
      weaken them:

      Use a permanent tenant-scoped model (Membership, Subscription,
      TeamInvitation) instead, or add the file to bin/remove-example.
